Preview file changes without making any actual modifications. Shows the exact diff that would be applied when the plan is implemented.

**IMPORTANT: The `path` parameter must be an absolute path** (e.g., `/Users/name/project/file.js`, not `./file.js` or relative paths).

Use only for showing definitive implementation, not for iterative exploration.
When crafting the `orginal_content`, you must match the original content from the `eca_read_file` tool output exactly, including all indentation (spaces/tabs) and newlines.
ALWAYS prefer making small, targeted content changes.
For new files, original_content must be empty string.
