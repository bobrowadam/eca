Create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content.
This tool will automatically create any necessary parent directories if they don't exist.
Use this tool when you want to create a new file from scratch or completely replace the entire content of an existing file.
For partial edits or content replacement within existing files, use eca_edit_file instead.
**Only works within the directories: {workspaceRoots}.**
